npm install
```

## Customization

You can easily customize the party details by editing the `InvitationCard.tsx` component:

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

#### Prerequisites
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Replace `yourusername` in `package.json` homepage field with your actual GitHub username
3. Install the gh-pages dependency: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`

#### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the main/master branch.

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Push your code to the main/master branch
5. The workflow will automatically build and deploy your site

#### Manual Deployment
To manually deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and push it to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages will serve.

### Custom Domain Setup

To use a custom domain instead of the default GitHub Pages URL:

1. **Configure DNS Records**:
   - For root domain (`yourdomain.com`): Add A records pointing to GitHub's IPs
   - For subdomain (`halloween.yourdomain.com`): Add CNAME record pointing to `username.github.io`

2. **Update GitHub Settings**:
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Enter your custom domain in the "Custom domain" field
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

3. **Update Project Configuration**:

   - Update the `public/CNAME` file with your domain

4. **Deploy**:
   - Push changes to trigger automatic deployment
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
